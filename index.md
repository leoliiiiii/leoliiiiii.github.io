# Welcome to My Home Page!

I'm Leo, a master student at Carnegie Mellon University specializing in big data and machine learning. I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [ScriptChain Health](https://scriptchain.co/home), contributing to cutting-edge projects addressing Cardiovascular diseases. Before entering Carnegie Mellon University, I earned my B.A. in Data Science and Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley.

My journey in machine learning and big data has been thrilling, and now I'm eager to pursue full-time opportunities to delve deeper into this dynamic field. Here is my [Resume](/assets/resume.pdf)

Feel free to get in touch for potential collaborations and opportunities!
